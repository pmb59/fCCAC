Description: Computational evaluation of variability across DNA or RNA 
        sequencing datasets is a crucial step in genomics, as it allows 
        both to evaluate reproducibility of replicates, 
        and to compare different datasets to identify potential 
        correlations. fCCAC applies functional Canonical Correlation
        Analysis to allow the assessment of: (i) reproducibility 
        of biological or technical replicates, analyzing their shared 
        covariance in higher order components; and (ii) the associations 
        between different datasets. fCCAC represents a more sophisticated 
        approach that complements Pearson correlation of genomic coverage.
